# Fedelity Card manager

## The Project 

Is an objective-c application for managing loyalty cards.
This project was made with xcode, for a university project of the course "mobile systems development" at @unipr.

### How it works
The application when it starts to see the list of cards that can be selected, once selected the system will display the store logo color card and customer code, and in the case from this page you can remove.

It is possible to create new cards through the "+" button where all the data will be inserted.

### improvements for the future 
Add a database and save data in a persistent way
